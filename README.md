## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No, I just followed the examples and made sure to read the description of what each snippet of code was doing. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? 
The most challenging part was ensuring my syntax was correct. I made sure to use the developer tools to quickly find any errors and correct them. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 
I actually wonder how secure this game is from being "hacked". I'm also really curious to see how quick a small game like this could be pushed from design to production with the use of a containerization service such as Docker. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 
I would probably try adding another button while also changing the sounds. However due to school and other IT bootcamps I unfortunately didn't have enough extra time.
